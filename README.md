# Hello-World
1. I took this course so that I can have abetter understanding on the game making process and better understanding of my computer process
2. I want to make a turn based strategy game about running and managing an empire by getting food, money, and resourses to produe buildings to better your city and produce units to fight other empires around you. this will probably be undoable because of the amount of programming needed but if I could cheapen it enough it will be close to what it could be.
